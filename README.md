# NLove - A new way to meet people on the blockchain

NLove is a tool to meet new people using the blockchain on NKN protocol.
User can join with their profile (e.g. Name: John, Year of birth: 1945, About text: 
I like trains) into a user pool and can issue a command to randomly contact one of the 
other users!

It is command line based and simple to use.

# Notes

When picking a random user that you can match with, only users that are online and connected 
will be used to match. The system does not have a database to store profiles, so stay 
more online to get more matches!

# Frequently asked questions

1) When I run the "roll" command, why do i get timeouts so often until it works? The 
command will ask a randomly selected subscriber of nlove who may be offline or slow 
to respond. Just wait until the automatic retry finds a match.
