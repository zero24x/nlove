NLove is a tool to meet new people using the blockchain on NKN + IOTa protocol.

i like coins) into a user pool and will be presented randomly other profiles. Alternatively the can join the hangout zone:

## Hangout zone
The "Hangout zone" is a public chat, everyone can write there, the messages are stored 
on the IOTA blockchain - IOTA rovides fast & free data transactions to send our chat messages.
If neede you can move e.g. to DM in D-Chat.

# Our community chat

Come and join our community chat channel #nlove on the [NKN Discord](https://discord.gg/8Yawr6z).

# Notes

When picking a random user that you can match with, only users that are online and connected 
will be used to match. The system does not have a database to store profiles, so stay 
more online to get more matches!

# Frequently asked questions

1) When I run the "roll" command, why do i get timeouts so often until it works? The 
command will ask a randomly selected subscriber of nlove who may be offline or slow 
to respond. Just wait until the automatic retry finds a match.
